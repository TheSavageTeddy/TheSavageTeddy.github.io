# About me

Hi! Welcome to my blog! I'm [`teddy`](https://ctftime.org/user/114547) (aka TheSavageTeddy), a highschool student and CTF player from Western Australia.

I play with team [`Emu Exploit`](https://ctftime.org/team/160273) (formerly PissedEmu), and do all categories but mostly crypto, pwn, rev, and currently learning web3.

This is my blog where I will post some CTF writeups and other interesting cyber related content! Enjoy!

Check out my [`Twitter`](https://twitter.com/teddyctf) to see what I've been up to recently (embed might be broken and show no tweets. I do tweet though!)
