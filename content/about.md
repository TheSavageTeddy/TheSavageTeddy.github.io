# About me

Hi! Welcome to my blog! I'm [`teddy`](https://ctftime.org/user/114547) (aka TheSavageTeddy), a highschool student and CTF player from Western Australia.

I play with team [`Emu Exploit`](https://ctftime.org/team/160273) (formerly PissedEmu), and do all categories but mostly crypto, and learning pwn & rev currently.

This is my blog where I will post some CTF writeups and other interesting cyber related content! Enjoy!

Check out my Twitter to see what I've been up to recently:
