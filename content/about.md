# About me

Hi! Welcome to my blog! I'm Rainier Wu, also known as [`teddy`](https://ctftime.org/user/114547) or `TheSavageTeddy`, a ~~highschool~~ first year uni student and CTF player from Australia.

I play with team [`Emu Exploit`](https://ctftime.org/team/160273) (formerly PissedEmu), and do all categories but mostly web3/blockchain, crypto, and pwn.

I also occasionally play with [`🤬🇫🇷🛹🐻`](https://ctftime.org/team/280849) and [`Friendly Maltese Citizens`](https://ctftime.org/team/220769).

This is my blog where I will post some CTF writeups and other interesting cyber related content! Enjoy!
