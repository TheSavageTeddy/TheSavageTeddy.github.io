# About me

Hi! Welcome to my blog! I'm [`uwuTeddy`](https://ctftime.org/user/114547) (aka TheSavageTeddy), a highschool student and CTF player from Western Australia.

I play with team [`Emu Exploit`](https://ctftime.org/team/160273) (formerly PissedEmu), and do all categories but mostly crypto, and learning pwn & rev currently.

I am not sure what to post as of now, but it'll probably be writeups for interesting challenges I've come across for CTFs! Enjoy!
